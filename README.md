Scrimba Solo Project from Module 3 - Basketball proj done with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

Simple counter app with 6 buttons that increment home and guest scores

Stretch goals:
Added a "New game", "Reset" and "End game" buttons;
Counter buttons are disabled before game is initialised and after is finished;
Added a countdown timer, a leading team display as well as a message that shows which team's leading the game;
Added a Winner display.

OBS: Although SOME stretch goals were met, I didn't want to get ahead of myself and decided to only use tools learned up to this lesson and project along with some prety simple research that allowed me to achieve these stretch goals.
